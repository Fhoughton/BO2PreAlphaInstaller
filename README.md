## How To Install & Run The Pre-Alpha
### Pre-Installation
This script does not provide the pre-alpha files, you must find them yourself and place them in the same folder as the files from this project

7zip must be installed for the program to work, if you do not have it then it may be downloaded from https://www.7-zip.org/

### Acquiring The Installer
To start click [here]() to get a zip file for the scripts, then extract it by right clicking in ```File Explorer``` and choosing ```Extract All``` then ```Extract```

### Installing The Alpha
With everything in place you can right click ```install-alpha.ps1``` and then choose ```Run with PowerShell```, this will open a blue window which will guide you through installing the files.

### The Patch
If you have the patch then after install paste it into the ```merged2``` folder, no worries if not but your game will be more unstable (crashing randomly vs after about 3 rounds). 

### Setting The Map
Before running the game you need to set a map externally, as the map selection is broken within the emulator. To do this right click ```select-map.ps1``` and choose ```Run with PowerShell```, which opens a blue window which lets you choose a map to make the game run.

### Running The Game
To start the game, having followed the installation, run ```start-alpha.ps1```.
